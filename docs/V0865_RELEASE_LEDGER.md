# v0.8.65 Release Ledger

Updated: 2026-06-24, America/Los_Angeles.

This ledger tracks the live v0.8.65 milestone by concrete outcome: merged on
`main`, replaced by a clean PR, closed with evidence, or deliberately moved out
of the milestone. It is not a public release record. Tags, package publishing,
GitHub Releases, and website deploys remain separate maintainer actions.

## Current Verdict

v0.8.65 is through the PR-churn closeout: every non-ledger release PR is
merged, auto-closed by a replacement merge, or explicitly closed with evidence.

The milestone itself is not empty. Maintainer direction reinstated four
reporter/user-facing items into v0.8.65 after the PR queue was cleared:
#3461, #3205, #2300, and #1519. Those are the remaining release slice, and
`docs/V0865_REMAINING_AGENT_PROMPT.md` is the focused handoff prompt for the
next agent.

The release is not publicly shipped from this ledger alone. Live truth on
2026-06-24: `refs/tags/v0.8.65` exists at `f1f79827128f28489eb852596d5f8df971370f29`,
but there is no GitHub Release for `v0.8.65`, and `./scripts/release/check-published.sh 0.8.65`
reports npm plus all `codewhale-*` crates unpublished. `origin/main` has moved
past that tag. Do not claim a final `0.8.65` public candidate includes post-tag
commits until Hunter chooses whether to publish the existing tag, retag the
unpublished release anchor, or move the remaining work to the next patch.

## PR Queue

| PR | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #3559 | Merged | Harvested @cy2311's zh-Hans JSON extraction, completed current localization coverage, moved the visible details shortcut to bare `v`, added the AUTHOR_MAP entry required by the harvest gate, and removed the stale internal `AltV` message id. Merge: `a7285ea5a2743d28d0c4bb4154526d0e727ac2fe`. |
| #3560 | Merged | Finished the remaining harness-profile split by moving built-in harness seeds and private matching helpers into `crates/config/src/harness.rs` while preserving crate-root exports. Merge: `ec29998cce511047f0a237f2be4d95e9c5108a05`. |
| #3561 | Merged | Harvested shared `integrations/bridge-core` helpers, patched review findings, and verified bridge-core plus Telegram, Feishu, WeCom, and Weixin checks/tests locally. Merge: `ead5165d433a3422625f55e0934443b50faad165`. |
| #3493 | Merged | Release ledger and remaining-agent prompt landed on `main`. Merge: `370bc45f345030f6a11c441e2a2a45b16fb3f63c`. |
| #3562 | Open draft | Passive MCP discovery for #3461 plus configured custom provider rows for #1519. CI was green when reviewed on 2026-06-24, but the release-source/tag decision should be resolved before merging more same-version work. |
| #3563 | Open draft | Factual model reference database and read-only `/modeldb` label browser for #3205/#2300. This is a labeling slice only, not Fleet loadout-auto completion. |
| #3549 | Merged/auto-associated through #3559 | GitHub marked the original contributor PR merged by the replacement merge commit; final evidence comment posted. |
| #3506 | Closed by #3560 | Final evidence comment posted. |
| #3432 | Merged/auto-associated through #3561 | GitHub marked the original draft PR merged by the replacement merge commit; final evidence comment posted. |

## Landed Release Work

## Required Closeout

1. Resolve the release-source mismatch before merging more same-version work:
   `v0.8.65` is already tagged, but `main` has advanced and no public release
   exists.
2. Use `docs/V0865_REMAINING_AGENT_PROMPT.md` to hand the four remaining
   v0.8.65 issues to the next implementation agent only after deciding whether
   those issues remain in `0.8.65` or move to the next patch.
3. After #3461, #3205, #2300, and #1519 are merged, retargeted, or clearly
   resolved, update this ledger again with the actual closeout evidence.
4. Hunter may perform the separate release-owner actions: final release
   verification, version/tag/package/GitHub Release/publish/deploy decisions.

## Verification Run During Closeout

- #3559: `cargo fmt --all --check`; exact CI clippy command; harvest credit
  checker; `localization::tests`; `tool_details_help_documents_bare_v_without_alt_v`;
  `open_tool_details_pager`.
- #3560: `cargo fmt --all --check`; `cargo test -p codewhale-config --locked harness`;
  `cargo test -p codewhale-config --locked`; `git diff --check`.
- #3561: `npm --prefix integrations/bridge-core run check && npm --prefix integrations/bridge-core test`;
  same `check && test` for Telegram, Feishu, WeCom, and Weixin bridges; `git diff --check`.
