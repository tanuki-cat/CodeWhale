# HarmonyOS and OpenHarmony

This page covers Codewhale on HarmonyOS PC and OpenHarmony cross-build setups.

## Running On HarmonyOS PC

HarmonyOS PC can use the normal Linux ARM64 package when its userspace is
glibc-compatible:

```bash
npm i -g codewhale
codewhale --version
```

You can also download `codewhale-linux-arm64` and
`codewhale-tui-linux-arm64` from the GitHub Releases page and place both
binaries on `PATH`.

## Cross-Compiling To OpenHarmony

The repository does not check in machine-specific SDK paths. Set
`OHOS_NATIVE_SDK` to the OpenHarmony native SDK directory, the directory that
contains `llvm/bin`, `sysroot`, and `build/cmake/ohos.toolchain.cmake`.

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:OHOS_NATIVE_SDK="<path-to-openharmony-native-sdk>"
. .\scripts\ohos-env.ps1
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos
cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos -p codewhale-cli
```

On Linux or macOS:

```bash
export OHOS_NATIVE_SDK=/path/to/openharmony/native
. ./scripts/ohos-env.sh
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos
cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos -p codewhale-cli
```

The setup scripts export Cargo's target-specific `linker`, `AR`, `CC`, `CXX`,
`CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS`, `CC_SHELL_ESCAPED_FLAGS`, and
CMake toolchain variables for `aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos`. They also point
`bindgen` at the SDK's `libclang` and sysroot so `rquickjs-sys` can generate
the OpenHarmony bindings that it does not ship pre-generated.

On Windows, `ohos-env.ps1` points Cargo at the repository's
`ohos-clang.cmd` launcher. The launcher delegates to `ohos-clang.ps1`, so the
final Rust link—not only C/C++ compilation and bindgen—always carries
`-target aarch64-linux-ohos`, the SDK sysroot, and `-D__MUSL__` while preserving
Cargo's linker arguments and exit status.

## Compiler Wrappers

For ad-hoc compiler calls, use the wrappers in `scripts/ohos/`. They read the same
`OHOS_NATIVE_SDK` variable and do not contain local paths.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\ohos\ohos-clang.ps1 --version
.\scripts\ohos\ohos-clangxx.ps1 --version
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
sh ./scripts/ohos/ohos-clang.sh --version
sh ./scripts/ohos/ohos-clangxx.sh --version
```

If you want to run the POSIX wrappers directly as `./scripts/ohos/ohos-clang.sh`, make them
executable first:

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/ohos/ohos-clang.sh ./scripts/ohos/ohos-clangxx.sh
```

## Linker And Toolchain Paths

The repository does not check in a Cargo linker path or CMake toolchain path.
Cargo cannot expand environment variables inside `linker` or CMake toolchain
path values, so those values are exported by `scripts/ohos-env.ps1` and
`scripts/ohos-env.sh` instead.

## Dependency Guard

Release prep runs a no-SDK dependency check:

```bash
./scripts/release/check-ohos-deps.sh
```

The guard asserts the Windows final-link wrapper contract, proves that OHOS
activates the `rquickjs-sys` bindgen feature, resolves the `codewhale-tui`
dependency graph for `aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos`, and fails if unsupported
host/UI crates re-enter that graph: `nix` 0.28/0.29, `portable-pty`, `starlark`,
`arboard`, or `keyring`. This no-SDK check does not replace a real SDK/sysroot
build, but it catches the known linker, bindgen, `starlark -> rustyline -> nix`,
and PTY/keyring regressions before release.

Because `portable-pty` is intentionally absent from the OpenHarmony graph, the
persistent `terminal/*` PTY tools are not registered on that target. The
ordinary `exec_shell` tools remain available through their non-PTY process
implementation.
