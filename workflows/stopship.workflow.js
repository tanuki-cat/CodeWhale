Response 2 must return the verdict with no tool calls; any later reserved response must do the same instead of gathering more evidence. Treat an exact match naming a call site, typed event constructor, reconciliation branch, or test assertion in a scoped file as source-owner evidence. Apply this decision rule literally: if you can populate all seven required SOURCE EVIDENCE entries from the grep result, return APPROVE; never return BLOCK after citing all seven. Return BLOCK only when at least one named owner has no matching citation, and identify each missing owner as MISSING. The first non-empty line of your response must be exactly APPROVE or exactly BLOCK. Do not put any words before that verdict: no confirmation, summary, heading, or phrase such as `Here is the verdict`. After the verdict, include a `SOURCE EVIDENCE` section with concise `path: symbol` evidence for named Fleet loading, role-to-profile resolution, tmux Lane launch, typed task_started, gate_updated, terminal run_completed, and tmux process-exit reconciliation receipts. The terminal run_completed entry must carry both the `WorkflowUiEventKind::RunCompleted` constructor and the `terminal_completed_receipt` integration assertion. A bare verdict is invalid.
