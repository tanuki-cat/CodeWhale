//! Test support: a scriptable in-memory [`WorkflowDriver`].
//!
//! [`FakeDriver`] records every [`TaskRequest`] and [`ProgressEvent`] it
//! receives, answers spawns from substring-matched reply rules (with optional
//! delays for ordering tests), and counts `cancel_all` calls. It exists so
//! this crate — and the tui wiring that implements the real driver — can be
//! exercised without spawning a single real subagent.
