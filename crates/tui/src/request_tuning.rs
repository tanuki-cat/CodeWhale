//! Request-tuning intent carried through CodeWhale request routing (#3024).
//!
//! Request "tuning" here means the optional knobs a caller can attach to an
//! outbound model request that shape *how* the model responds without changing
//! *what* it is asked: the reasoning-effort tier and the maximum number of
//! output tokens. This module only carries that intent between routing layers.
//! Client code is still responsible for translating the intent into each
//! provider's wire format.
//!
//! ## Reasoning-effort enum reuse
//!
//! [`RequestTuning::reasoning_effort`] reuses the canonical
//! [`crate::tui::app::ReasoningEffort`] enum rather than defining a local
//! `Off/Low/Medium/High` copy. That enum is the single source of truth for the
//! effort tiers across the DeepSeek and Codex effort pickers, it is already
//! imported by sibling top-level modules (`auto_reasoning`, `model_routing`),
//! and it carries the provider-normalization logic (`normalize_for_provider`,
//! `api_value_for_provider`) that a future request-tuning consumer will need.
//! Defining a parallel local enum here would duplicate that surface and risk
//! drift, so we import the existing type.
//!
