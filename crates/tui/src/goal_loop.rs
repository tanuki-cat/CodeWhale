//! Goal loop orchestrator — the persistent-objective control layer (#3215, and
//! its lineage #891 / #1976 / #2058 / #2029).
//!
//! This is the **WhaleFlow goal layer**: the decision core that turns a one-shot
//! `/goal` into a persistent work loop. Given the durable goal status, the
//! accumulated usage (from the per-goal accounting wired in `crates/state`
//! `record_thread_goal_usage`), and a budget, it decides whether to **continue**
//! (re-dispatch another worker turn toward the objective) or **stop** with a
//! terminal status. It is the orchestrator in the WhaleFlow≈ultracode mapping —
//! the loop that fans work out to workers (`worker_profile`) and verifies before
//! committing.
//!
//! Scope: **decision logic + types**. The engine (`core/engine.rs`) reads the
//! `SharedGoalState` snapshot after each turn and calls `decide_continuation`
//! to decide whether to re-dispatch. There is **no continuation cap** — a goal
//! runs until the model self-reports complete/blocked, the user pauses or
//! clears, or an optional token/time budget is exhausted. This matches how a
//! persistent objective should feel: "until done," not "until N turns."
