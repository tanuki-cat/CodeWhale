//! Unified context-budget math for the TUI.
//!
//! Given a model's context window, the current input token estimate, and a
//! configured output cap, [`ContextBudget`] derives the four numbers the rest
//! of the app needs to reason about a turn:
//!
//!   * **available input budget** — how many input tokens may still be spent
//!     after reserving room for the model's output;
//!   * **output token cap** — the output reservation actually used to compute
//!     that budget (clamped so it never starves the window);
//!   * **compaction trigger** — the input-token level at which compaction
//!     should be suggested (default: ~75% of the window);
//!   * **[`PressureLevel`]** — a coarse Low/Medium/High/Critical signal the UI
//!     can render without re-deriving thresholds.
//!
//! This module is the budget-math *foundation*. It is intentionally pure (no
//! I/O, no clock, no engine/config types) so it can be unit-tested in isolation
//! and later consumed by the engine capacity checkpoints and the TUI pressure
//! indicator. Those consumers are wired in a separate pass; nothing here calls
//! into them.
//!
//! ### Why the output reservation is window-dependent
//!
//! The engine's existing input-budget helper
//! (`core::engine::context::context_input_budget_for_window`) computes
//! `window - reserved_output - headroom` and learned the hard way that
//! reserving a large fixed output (262K for V4-class interleaved thinking) on a
//! *small* self-hosted window (e.g. a 256K vLLM deployment) underflows to a
//! negative budget and silently disables every preflight/recovery path. We
//! mirror that lesson here with saturating arithmetic and an output cap that is
//! always clamped to leave at least [`MIN_INPUT_BUDGET_TOKENS`] of input room,
//! so the budget can never collapse to zero on a legitimately sized window.

// Foundation module: the public surface is exercised by unit tests but is not
// yet referenced by the engine capacity checkpoints or the TUI pressure
// indicator (those consumers are wired in a later pass). Allow dead_code so the
// substrate can land warning-clean ahead of its callers, matching how other
// not-yet-wired primitives in this crate are gated.
//
// Note: the context report now consumes `PressureLevel::from_usage_percent` and
// `label`, but the rest of the substrate (`ContextBudget` and its methods,
// `PressureLevel::suggests_compaction`) is still pending its engine/TUI
// consumers, so the blanket allow stays until those land.
